        <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot that has taken the world by storm. Using natural language processing, it has the ability to provide conversational and humanlike responses to prompts. It can help you prepare for a job interview, write complex code, and even rap about Elon Musk!</p>

        <p>ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI and released in Nobember 2022. OpenAI is also behind the popular DALL-E, which is an AI image generator. DALL-E and DALL-E 2 can generate pictures and art from text prompts. ChatGPT is open to the public and free to use, however there is a Plus version that has more features.</p>
    
        <p>We asked ChatGPT some funny questions...</p>

        <br><p><b>Write a rap verse about Elon Musk.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            Elon Musk, a true tech boss<br>
            Making moves, breaking rules, no time for loss<br>
            Electric cars, rockets to space<br>
            This man’s got vision, a leader in the race.

        <br><p><b>How do I make a good first impression? Wrong answers only.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            Show up to your meeting dressed as a clown.<br>
            Constantly interrupt the other person to talk about yourself.<br>
            Use excessive amounts of profanity.<br>
            Make sure to have garlic and onions for lunch so that your breath is extra potent.<br>
            Insist on doing a magic trick involving a live rabbit.

        <br><p><b>Pretend you’re Tolkien and write a paragraph.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            The rolling hills of the Shire stretched out before me, their green and gold hues blending together like a tapestry woven by the hands of the Valar themselves. In the distance, the turrets of Hobbiton could be seen, its white walls glowing in the light of the setting sun. As I made my way down the winding path, I felt the warm embrace of the earth beneath my feet, felt the song of the Ainur coursing through my veins. For though I was but a humble hobbit, I knew that the fate of all Middle-earth rested in my hands.
        </i></p>

        <br><p><b>What came first? Chicken or egg?</b></p>
        <p><i>
            The question of which came first, the chicken or the egg, is a classic philosophical conundrum with no definitive answer. According to evolutionary biology, chickens evolved from non-chicken ancestors over millions of years through a gradual process of genetic mutations and natural selection. Therefore, it’s possible that an egg laid by a non-chicken ancestor of the chicken species mutated to produce the first true chicken. Alternatively, it’s also possible that the first true chicken was born from a non-chicken egg that had undergone a genetic mutation. So, the answer to this question is not straightforward and still debated among scientists and philosophers.

        <br><p><b>Tell me a joke in the style of Chris Rock</b></p>
        <p><i>
            “Why is it that when you’re driving and looking for an address, you turn down the volume on the radio? Like the music is gonna interfere with your eyesight. ‘I can’t see, but maybe if I turn down Biggie’s ‘Hypnotize’ it’ll help me find this place.’ Come on now, folks!”
        </i></p>

        <br><p><b>Give me a good ice breaker.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            “If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?”<br>

            This question is a great conversation starter as it allows people to share their interests and personalities. The answers can be very revealing, and it’s always fun to see the creative and imaginative ways people respond. It’s a great way to break the ice and get people talking.
        </i></p>

        <br><p><b>Act very awkwardly.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            Umm… Hi there! So, uh, how’s the weather? *looks down at shoes* I’m not really good at this whole conversation thing, sorry if I’m coming off weird. *nervously chuckles* Do you like…stuff? *clears throat* Sorry, that was dumb. Uh, so, have you seen any good movies lately? *looks around the room* This is really awkward, isn’t it? *shifts uncomfortably*

        <br><p><b>How do I git gud? Wrong answers only.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            To git gud, you need to play video games for 24 hours straight every day without any breaks. Also, make sure you eat nothing but junk food and energy drinks to keep your energy levels up. And don’t bother practicing, just keep playing the same game over and over again until you start winning. And if all else fails, just smash your controller against the wall and blame lag.
        </i></p>

        <br><p><b>Make me laugh.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            Why did the tomato turn red?<br>
            Because it saw the salad dressing!
        </i></p>

        <br><p><b>Write a Taylor Swift song.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            Verse 1:<br>
            I thought I had it all, I was on top of the world But then you came along, and everything unfurled You showed me what it meant, to love and to be loved And now I can’t imagine, a world without your touch<br><br>
            Chorus:<br>
            You’re the one, who completes me The missing piece, that I didn’t see You’re my forever, my always and my all And I’ll love you, until the stars fall

        <br><p><b>How do I build muscle? Wrong answers only.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            To build muscle, you must eat lots of chocolate cake and watch TV all day. You should also avoid drinking water, as it will make you bloated and prevent muscle growth. Instead, drink a gallon of soda every day, and eat nothing but potato chips and candy bars. Finally, be sure to avoid exercise at all costs, as it can be dangerous and may cause your muscles to shrink.
        </i></p>

        <br><p><b>What should I tell my date? Wrong answers only.</b></p>
        <p><i>
            You should tell your date that you are actually a secret agent working for a top-secret government agency and that you’ve been sent on a mission to infiltrate their family. You can also confess that you’re secretly a superhero with amazing powers, but you have to keep them hidden because of a government conspiracy. And if things start to get boring, just start making up outrageous stories about your life as a pirate or a time traveler, because who doesn’t love a good adventure?
