        <p><b>Get the Yunzii KC68 on <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Omteca">Amazon</a></b></p>
                            
        <p>Yunzii sent me their KC68 for review, and it’s really exciting to see 65% prebuilts popping up on the market. We’re seeing this once niche form factor become more accessible, and already there are a plethora of budget-friendly options like the KBD67 Lite, NK65, TM680 and GamaKay LK67, just to name a few—even Razer has thrown their hat into the ring with the BlackWidow v3 Mini. Another thing I really like here is the different colourways, and you can get the KC68 in Lavender, Mint or Shimmer, not to mention an additional translucent case option. On top of that, Yunzii includes extra keycaps for further customisation. This is so much better than the boring and generic black or white keycaps, and saves you the time and money of having to buy a third party set. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with Yunzii’s KC84 series, so let’s see if the KC68 can match its bigger brother.</p>
        
        <figure>

        </figure>
        
       <p>The KC68 comes with the reliable Gateron switches, and we have the Gateron Blacks on here. Lately I’ve been liking a heavier spring weight on my switches, and I must say I really enjoyed these Blacks with a bottom out force of 75g. I’m looking to put 65g springs on my Alpacas and Black Inks; I feel that it’s a good balance between typing and gaming. Like the KC84 boards, the KC68 is hot-swappable with a north-facing configuration, and we have the Gateron sockets on this PCB. Once again I was very impressed with the stock performance and sound of the board. You’d be hard-pressed to find a sub $100 mech with a better stock typing experience and sound. </p>
        
       <p>There is a sheet of sound dampening foam between the PCB and plate, which eliminates most of the metal ping. It also ensures that the board doesn’t sound too hollow, and you could of course add case foam to help with that. Overall the stabilisers are good, and they come thoroughly pre-lubed. I did pick up some minor rattle on space bar, but this can easily be fixed by rebalancing the wire. Yunzii is running XDA keycaps on the KC68, and this profile has really grown on me. If you’re used to Cherry or OEM, it might feel strange initially, but if you stick with it it becomes very comfortable. XDA is quite similar to ASA with that spherical top, however all the rows are uniform and it has a flat profile. The keys also have a slightly bigger surface area.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The 67 and 68-key are very popular layouts as you get a good combination of functionality and small form factor. This board has dedicated arrow keys and the extra keys are tilde, Delete, Page Up and Page Down, however you can remap these with the software. The Fn layer is very comprehensive, with the inclusion of the F-Row, Nav Cluster and media controls. There is also a Windows/Mac toggle option, and the board has a unique set of Fn functions for Mac—super convenient if you’re a Mac user.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The Mint colourway looks really attractive on the white chassis. I actually wanted to try these caps on my KBD67 Lite, but this is a 68-key of course, so the bottom right modifiers are 1U as opposed to 1.25. The KC68 comes with full RGB and there are 18 different colour modes. The case actually has side lighting, but this will only really be noticeable if you go for the translucent ABS case. It looks kind of strange on this opaque white version. The RGB can be controlled with the Fn layer or software.</p>
        
        <figure>

            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: gray;">So priddy!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>No issues with build quality, and we have the typical plastic enclosure with a steel mounting plate. The case has a screwless design where the PCB is sandwiched between two click-in pieces. Some minor creakiness here and there on the chassis, but not a deal-breaker by any means. The bottom features dual flip outs so you get two extra typing angles, but as per usual I didn’t need these and preferred the natural angle of the case. The keyboard comes with a detachable USB-C cable that matches the white colour of the chassis. These are dye-subbed PBT keycaps with walls of 1.3mm, so excellent quality for $90. The board has some decent heft to it at over 750g.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The software can be found on <a href="https://www.yunzii.com/" target="_blank">Yunzii’s website</a>, however it is still hosted on Google Drive. Even though there isn’t single key remapping, I was able to make my preferred keymap by recording some macros. For example I like to have my Delete on Caps Lock, and then for the extra keys I like to have Home, End and volume controls. The board also has on-board memory so my keymap persisted after closing the software. This is quite nice as you can run the software once, make the changes, and then uninstall. The RGB controls include a customisable static mode, and then you have all the Fn layer controls like brightness and speed.</p>

        <p>Now I did mention that these stabilisers are thoroughly lubed, although upon taking them out I noticed it wasn’t very consistent, so I’d definitely recommend reapplying your own lube. I got a big improvement by putting on some Dielectric Grease, and then I rebalanced the space bar wire. I had just enough Krytox 205g0 left to lube these Gateron Blacks, and I must say I was immensely impressed with the sound profile after lubing. This board has such a nice soft and gentle sound, and it gives my two custom mechs a run for their money!</p>
    
        <p>You really cannot go wrong with Yunzii’s KC68 or KC84 series. It’s just a matter of which layout you prefer. These boards offer very solid stock performance with a unique aesthetic, not to mention a strong list of features that include hot-swap, PBT keycaps and a detachable cable. This is a definite recommend at $90.</p>
