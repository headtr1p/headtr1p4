        <p><b>Get the Ajazz Diced Fruit Kiwi on <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3McO8rJ">Amazon</a></b></p>
                            
        <p>Today we’re taking a look at the Epomaker Ajazz Diced Fruit Kiwi switch. This switch forms part of the Diced Fruit series, a collaboration between Ajazz and Huano. There are currently four switches in the series namely the Banana, Kiwi, Peach and Blueberry. These come in at a very affordable $20 per 45 pack, which amounts to 45 cents per switch. That price tag looks even more attractive when you take into account that they come factory lubed. Always nice to see thorough packaging, especially for switches, and the Diced Fruit switches come in a PET canister, so you don’t need to worry about pins getting bent during shipping.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p>What drew me to this particular switch was the Kiwi-themed housing. I really like the colours they went for, and you can even see small Kiwi seeds inside the housing. This is a very unique and compelling aesthetic, and with all the ostentatious switch designs we’re seeing nowadays, I think this switch looks elegant while not being over the top.</p>
                        
        <p>The Diced Fruit switches come in the Gateron housing, and they are 3-pin switches that are compatible with SMD LEDs. The housing material is the typical nylon and polycarbonate combination, featuring a stainless steel spring. There are a few interesting things to note here, the first of which is the longer stem pole. This is something we’re seeing on more and more switches, as a longer stem pole typically increases the thockiness of a switch. It also gives the switch a lower travel distance. The Kiwi switch has a high tactile position, so the lower travel distance is actually a good thing as it decreases the post travel after the bump.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img class="img-fluid w-100 mb-2" src="../img/DicedKiwi4.jpg" style="object-fit: cover;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Housing material</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The other thing to take note of here is the two stage extension spring. This spring is longer than a standard spring, which has a few implications for the typing experience. Firstly, the switch will have more preload, so it has a higher initial force. The reason for this is greater compression in the spring, even before the switch has been pressed. So the switch will feel stiff initially, and have a slower progression of force throughout the keystroke, and there is also a smaller gap between the actuation and bottom out force. This is known as a slow force curve. On the graph we see the higher initial force and the gradual curve in comparison to a more standard spring. Where the longer spring starts heavy and gradually increases in force, the standard spring starts lighter and there is a steeper increase. So apart from increasing the initial force, the switch will also have a more snappy return to the top. The reason for this again is the greater compression in the spring. So these Kiwis will have a quick snapback after bottoming out.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img class="img-fluid w-100 mb-2" src="../img/DicedKiwi1.jpg" style="object-fit: cover;">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; color: gray;">Two stage extension spring vs standard spring</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The longer spring has become quite popular among enthusiasts. For a linear switch this could create the feeling of a more consistent downstroke, and for a tactile switch it can intensify the tactile bump, especially if the switch has a high tactile position, which is the case for the Kiwi. Then of course that fast snapback is also a desirable feature, especially for tactile switches.</p>

        <p>So to summarise, the Kiwi feels fairly heavy at the top, and it has a high tactile position with a very strong and rounded bump. After the bump, there is a low amount of post-travel, and then we have that fast snapback after bottoming out. Looking at the tactility alone, it’s quite similar to the Boba U4T in that it has a rounded bump, however the bump definitely feels stronger and more punchy.</p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>The Kiwi comes factory lubed, and the lube has been applied to the stem legs and stem pole. I don’t really think the factory lube does much here, except maybe make the switches a tiny bit smoother. Nonetheless the stock performance is more than decent, and they didn’t feel too scratchy, however I did pick up some spring ping and spring crunch, which was quite pronounced on a few individual switches. But once the switches are installed in a keyboard, the ping wasn’t really noticeable, and you can definitely use them stock. The Kiwis have a nice thocky and loud bottom out, but I did find the stock sound quite thin and high pitched, which is completely normal for a stock switch of course.</p>
    
        <p>After applying my Krytox 205g0 and 105 mix, there was actually a big improvement in the sound. The Kiwis had a lower pitch and a much thicker and richer sound. So I think the sound improvement alone makes it worth lubing these. But as always, sound is subjective, and there is nothing wrong with the stock sound. There was a very minor reduction in tactility after lubing, but the increase in smoothness makes the tradeoff worthwhile.</p>
    
        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>Looking at the stem wobble, it’s very similar to a JWK switch, where we have low wobble on the East-West line, with a little bit more on the North-South. Very good tolerances on the housing as well, and there was almost no looseness, even after opening and closing the switches. The only reason to use films here would be if you’re looking for a change in sound. So overall this is very similar performance to JWK, which is obviously a big compliment. Definitely have to give kudos to Ajazz and Huano here.</p>

        <p>The Ajazz Kiwi is another strong budget tactile switch, and it’s really exciting to see all these affordable options popping up. This switch offers a very tactile and punchy typing experience with a satisfying thocky sound profile, whether it’s stock or lubed. I can’t really choose between this and the Boba U4T; they’re both superb switches. If you’re a tactile user, the Diced Fruit Kiwi comes highly recommended.</p>
